# 🚦 Automatic Railway Level Crossing System (Arduino-based)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Automatic Railway Level Crossing System** using **Arduino Uno, sensors, and motors** to detect an approaching train and control barrier gates & signals accordingly. The system improves **railway safety** by automating the process of opening and closing the level crossing.

## 🔧 Features
- **Train Detection**: Uses **strain gauges** as sensors to detect train arrival and departure.
- **Automated Barrier Control**: Lowers and raises barriers using **DC motors**.
- **Traffic Signal Control**: Automatically changes **red/green signals** for road users.
- **Low-Power Design**: Efficient use of **microcontroller & sensors** for continuous operation.
